# Employee Payroll System in Java

Welcome to the **Employee Payroll System**, a terminal-based Java application that demonstrates the practical implementation of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles. This project reflects my understanding and application of **abstraction, inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism** through a real-world payroll scenario.
